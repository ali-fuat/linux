sleep 20 &         #does not wait 20 seconds, sends command to background and makes terminal available. When execution completes it will show the result.

cd abc && ls       #try to go to abc folder and if it succeeds it will run ls also

cd abc || ls      #try to go to abc, if it fails run ls

cd abd && echo "I am in abd" || echo "No abd folder"   

echo I can use \* as wildcard       #it does not interpret *

cd \
>abc                 #equal to "cd abc"
